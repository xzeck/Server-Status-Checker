This is a simple server status checker , made to check if the server is up. I made it as a side project because I was bored, took about 10minutes to make this.


Note : Do not enter "https://www." to the URL , because it will be entered by the program itself.
If entered it will cause conflict , it still has some issues with it.

Issues : Sometimes the status comes in as the website is down ,eventhough its working. It only happens with some websites 
most of the ones I tested came back with a positive result.

Hope you guys would like it , let me know if there are any issues.
