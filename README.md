This is a simple server status checker , made to check if the server is up 

Note : Do not enter "https://www." to the URL , because it will be entered by the program itself.
If entered it will cause conflict , it still has some issues with it.

Issues : Sometimes the status comes in as the website is down ,eventhough its working. It only happens with some websites 
most of the ones I tested came back with a positive result.
